## What and How to Submit
LSAI accepts several types of submissions for review, including:

* Full papers (10-12 pages)
* Short papers (max 8 pages)
* Extended Abstract (max 1 page)<br>
References are excluded from page count.

## Submission Guidelines
Authors are invited to submit original research papers which have not been published elsewhere and which are not currently under consideration for another journal, conference, or workshop. Extended abstracts may present work that can be already published, in preparation for publication elsewhere, or ongoing research.

Submissions of papers must be in English, in PDF format, and formatted following the new CEUR-ART 1-column style ([Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw)).

The review process follows the guidelines of [the main conference](https://hhai-conference.org/2025/). At least two reviewers will evaluate submissions on the basis of originality, clarity, and technical quality. To submit a paper, please use the following web portal.

As established by HHAI, **authors of accepted submissions must register to the workshop session of the conference**. Information on registration options and fees will be shared on the [main conference's website](https://hhai-conference.org/2025/) as soon as it is available.

### Publication

All accepted workshop papers will be published in the dedicated proceedings of the main conference offered by CEUR Workshop Proceedings. **Publication is subject to in-person presentation of the contribution**. Since HHAI is not a hybrid conference, we *cannot* accept remote presentations.

LSAI Co-Chairs are also open to the possibility of publishing a special issue of a journal for the best papers of the workshop.
